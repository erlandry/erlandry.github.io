    <h1 class="frame_title">Frame treatment</h1>
    <p class="frame_text">This frame was treated for an exhibition of Northern Renaissance works at Yale University Art Gallery.
      It houses a painting by Van Dyck.
      "A condition survey of more than two hundred items showed that several damaged frames needed full
      conservation, such as cleaning, replacement of lost ornament, in-gilding and toning."
      "The majority of frames required minimal preventive conservation treatment, which included dusting and
      consolidation. Each of the frames requiring full conservation were examined with the naked eye and under
      magnification in order to decide on an appropriate conservation treatment.

My work mainly consisted of the conservation of three of the more severely damaged gilded frames. As part of the
 treatments I wanted to retain as much of the original surface as possible and to choose reversible conservation
 treatments, which would result in the least alteration of the original material. For these reasons I used a
 combination of both traditionally prepared materials and non-traditional materials and gilding techniques.
 Traditional techniques were used for preparing the surface of the gilding and a non-traditional gilding system
 was used for the application of the gold leaf."

      It was consolidated using isenglass and ???. The inpainting was done using Qor gouache paints.</p>

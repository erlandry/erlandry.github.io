        <p>&emsp;&emsp;One might think Sol LeWitt's work would bypass a conservator almost completely, but a
           25 year long exhibition at Mass MOCA of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings
          features a work that required some intervention. Wall Drawing #38 is a work made using tissue paper and a peg board, where
          the directions are "....". The piece needed to be reinstalled every two years because
          the yellow tissue paper would fade almost to white. John Hogan asked the conservation lab
          to extend the lightfastness of the tissue paper. I performed all steps of this projects attempting
          to match the both the color and texture of the original paper to the best of my ability. In order to do this I:

            <div class="sol_box" id="one">
              <p>Tested different pigments and binders to match the color and texture of the orignal paper. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="sol_box" id="two">
              <p>Tried different applications on the paper and drying techniques.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sol_box" id="three">
              <p>After coming up with a satisfactory outcome, built a mockup using the real and fabricated tissue paper.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sol_box" id="four">
              <p>I took color measurements of the original tissue paper and painted paper using iControl software which measured
                the colors white value, red/green axis value and yellow/blue axis value.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sol_box" id="five">
              <p>I performed a fading test on the paper. They were placed in an exposure cabinet at 200,000 lux for 24 hours.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sol_box" id="six">
              <p>I took measurements of the paper after their time in an exposure cabinet. The original paper faded as expected
                (the yellow almost entirely). The yellow paper I had painted had only faded 0.35 delta E. </p>
